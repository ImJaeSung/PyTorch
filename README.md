This repository is created for those who are new to PyTorch. It aims to introduce the fundamental concepts and usage of PyTorch, covering the basics that are essential for beginners to understand and start experimenting with PyTorch in their machine learning or deep learning projects.

## Introduction

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible and intuitive framework for building and training neural networks. This repository contains tutorials, example codes, and exercises to get you started with PyTorch.

Each tutorial is accompanied by example code to demonstrate the concepts in practice.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the tutorials and code examples, make sure you have the required software installed on your machine.
